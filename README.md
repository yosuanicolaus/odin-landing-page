my 2nd project at The Odin Project Foundations program

Thank you, The Odin Project. By building this project, not only that I made a beautiful website, I've also understand how flexbox works completely.
I'm definitely better at using flexbox than before I do this project. Thank you very much for that.

note: I didn't add any image and context YET to the website, as I'm really focusing on my developing flexbox skill.
I will probably add them later so I can present this website in my portfolio
